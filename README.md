## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS


### What I learned

I challenged myself to code this game in one day, so it's definitely not perfect. I'm not very comfortable with class constructors, and I'm sure I can make it more clear and efficient. I really loved making the game mechanics.
My Sass structure is a mess, but I think the UI is ok, if I had more time I would have cleaned it a bit.
I wanted to hide any information on the HTML side, therefore it would have been easy to cheat with dev tools, so every card is rendered dynamically.


### Continued development

I didn't use localstorage to save the game state and it would be a good idea to do so in the future. I would also be nice to have a leaderboard.
